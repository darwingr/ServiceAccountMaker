Usage:
	chmod 755 mk_service_user.sh
	sudo mk_service_user.sh newusername

Useage Scenario:
	I want to run some startup services, each as its own user, on Mac OSX(10.10) using launchd from system startup.
	This will be used for plex media server, SickRage(Sickbeard), transmission-daemon.
	Used to work with pocket-mine server as well.

How it works:
	A uid/gid is assigned starting and descending from 499 (mac daemon user id range = ?-499).
	Shell access and login is revoked.
	Password seems removed..
	Creates a home folder in /usr/local/HOME with proper ownership and group permissions.


Thanks to users "David Hein" and "par" on serverfault.com for the script to tweak/build-upon.
